# Yoga Pose Classifications using MoveNet

This is a project experiments every well known model for image classifications and the MoveNet model with customized Keras model for classifications

In order to run the every model, run the main MoveNet one first, then run the others later on. This project also required a lot of RAM to run as more Yoga poses added into (Tested with 12GB of RAM for 20 Yoga Poses Classes).
