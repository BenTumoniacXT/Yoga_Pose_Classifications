# Yoga Pose Classifications using MoveNet

<div align="center"><img src="Yoga-82\sample.png" alt="An example of Yoga Poses classification"/></div>

This is a project experiments every well known model for image classifications and the MoveNet model with customized Keras model for classifications

In order to run the every model, run the main MoveNet one inside Customize_pose_classification_Main.ipynb file in Notebook folder first, then run the others later on. You may want to manually download training data inside Yoga-82 folder and put it into your project. This project also required a lot of RAM to run as more Yoga poses added into (Tested with 12GB of RAM for 20 Yoga Poses Classes). You may also run any other included model on other notebooks for comparision.
